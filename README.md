# Challenge-Code-Refactor
This is the Repository for Challenge 1: Code Refactor
I improved this website by improving its search engine optimization by helping it become more accessible for people with disabilities and requiring the help of certain technology like screen readers.
I achieved this by using alt tags and putting sections of the html page into article tags to help screen reading technology to understand that everything in the article tags is related and should be read as so. 
I helped add many comments throughout the HTML and CSS files to signify all my changes and followed the scout rule to help leave the code better than I found it. The code seemed very disorganized under the CSS file and helped reorganize it to follow the flow of the semantic elements and the webpage.
I also changed the title of the website from website to Horiseon so that the tab of the web page matches the webpage so it helps with search engine optimization.
While doing so I also made it to where all links within the webpage help take the user to each section of that page.
